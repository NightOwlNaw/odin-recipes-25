Hello,
It's September 9, 2025. My name is NightOwl and I am following a course called the The Odin Project.
Previous attempts to finish this course failed, but I had a lot of fun.
So, I am back and trying it again. I'm older now, and so, so much wiser ;)

This project is part of the foundations course, have an older version somewhere
For practice purposes (and also because I need to refresh my memory),
I'm starting from scratch.

The aim of this project is to practice all the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far. 
I am building a recipe website. It will consist of a main index page which
will have links to a few recipes. Simple, but effective.

Have fun!
