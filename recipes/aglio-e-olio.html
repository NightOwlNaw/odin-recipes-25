        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti aglio e olio is a classic Neapolitan pasta dish known for its
            simplicity and rich flavor, made with garlic, olive oil, and pasta. It
            is celebrated for using inexpensive, pantry-staple ingredients and is
            often referred to as "midnight pasta", due to its ease of preparation.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti: 450g</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil: 120 ml</li>
            <li>Garlic: 6 cloves, thinly sliced (or 12 cloves for stronger flavor)</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes: 0.25 teaspoon (or to taste)</li>
            <li>Fresh Italian parsley: 0.25 cup, finely chopped.</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper: to taste</li>
            <li>Parmigiano Reggiano cheese: 0.5 cup, freshly grated (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of slated water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and
                cook until al dente, typically 8 to 12 minutes, following package
                instructions.
            </li>
            <li>Whil the pasta cooks, prepare the sauce. In a large skillet, combine
                the olive oil and sliced garlic. Place the skillet over medium-low
                heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is golden brown
                and fragrant. <strong>Do not let it burn, as it will turn bitter</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the red pepper flakes, a pinch of salt, and black pepper to the
                garlic-infused oil. Stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>Drain the cooked pasta, reserving 1 cup of the starchy pasta water.
                Immediately transfer the hot pasta to the skillet with the garlic oil.
            </li>
            <li>Toss the pasta vigorously with the oil, adding a splash of the reserved
                pasta water to create a silky emulsion that coats the strands. Continue
                adding pasta water as needed until the sauce is well combined and glossy.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir the chopped parsley and grated
                Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (if usiing).
            </li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or pepper if needed. Serve
                immediately, garnished with additional cheese, red pepper fglakes, and
                lemon wedges if desired.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Pro tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Storage: store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up
                to 3 days. Reheat gently with a splash of water or broth to restore
                moisture.
            </li>
            <li>The key to a succesful aglio e olio is creating an emulsion with the 
                starchy pasta water, which helps the oil adhere to the pasta.
            </li>
            <li>Use high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor.</li>
            <li>For a more intense garlic taste, some recipes recommend leaving
                the toasted garlic pieces in the oil.
            </li>
        </ul>
